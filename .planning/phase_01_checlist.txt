✅ Phase 0 Exit Checklist (Geometry & Topology Extraction)
A. Required Artifacts

 Normalized SVG paths for all attempted glyphs

 Arc-length sample arrays saved

 Raster images saved

 Skeleton images saved (where successful)

 metadata.json with per-glyph + per-font stats

B. Invariants

 Normalization is glyph-local (not alphabet-relative)

 Sampling is arc-length based (not parametric)

 Skeletonization operates on filled glyphs

 No ML, no learned parameters

C. Metrics

 Per-glyph:

arc length

aspect ratio

skeleton pixel count

components / endpoints / junctions

 Alphabet-level aggregates computed

 Junction degree histogram present

D. Failures & Blockers

 List of glyphs with:

missing paths

zero-length paths

skeleton failure

 Corner cases documented (e.g. g, Q, y, S)

 Reasons hypothesized (not guessed)

E. Validation Evidence

 At least one font with:

clean skeletons

broken skeletons

 Side-by-side raster vs skeleton images saved

 One example where topology is clearly wrong

F. Disallowed States

 Any skeleton fix without logging → STOP

 Any font-wide normalization → STOP
