PHASE EXIT CHECKLIST — Phase {N}

A. REQUIRED ARTIFACTS (existence + location)
[ ] Source code committed (commit hashes listed)
[ ] dev_diary.md entries exist for every commit (timestamps verified)
[ ] All planned outputs saved to disk (paths listed)
[ ] Configuration / constants frozen or justified

B. INVARIANTS (must be demonstrably true)
[ ] Phase-specific invariants listed and validated
[ ] No cross-phase concepts introduced
[ ] No undocumented heuristics or “temporary” logic

C. METRICS & OBSERVATIONS
[ ] Metrics computed as defined in plan
[ ] Metrics logged to disk (JSON / CSV)
[ ] Summary statistics included in diary

D. FAILURES & BLOCKERS
[ ] All failures logged with:
    - Trigger condition
    - Scope (glyphs / fonts / steps)
    - Hypothesized cause
[ ] No silent patches or unlogged workarounds
[ ] Known limitations explicitly enumerated

E. VALIDATION EVIDENCE
[ ] Visual artifacts saved (images / plots)
[ ] Validation method stated (not just “looks good”)
[ ] At least one negative or edge-case example included

F. DISALLOWED STATES (hard stop)
[ ] Any TODOs blocking correctness → STOP
[ ] Any unreviewed failures → STOP
[ ] Any phase leakage → STOP
