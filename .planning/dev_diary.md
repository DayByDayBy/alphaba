### 2026-01-09 - Step P0.01: Initialize Dev Diary

**Changed**: Created `.planning/dev_diary.md` to track all implementation decisions and changes throughout Phase 1 and Phase 2.

**Why**: This diary provides traceability for architectural decisions and debugging context. Each step appends exactly one entry explaining what changed and why.

**Limitation**: None. This is pure infrastructure.
