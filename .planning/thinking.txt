1. Font Parsing - Composite Handling

Composite glyphs must be fully resolved into concrete contours before path construction. The returned Path may contain multiple subpaths (for glyphs like 'i', 'j', or '%').

2. Normalization Scope

Normalization is glyph-local, not alphabet-relative. Cross-glyph alignment is deferred to Phase 1+.

3. Rasterization - Stroke Semantics

Stroke is additive, never substitutive. Stroke width is specified in output pixel space, not font units.

4. Skeletonization - Topology Limits

Skeletonization operates on connected components independently. Topology is preserved only insofar as the raster permits—discretization limits are acknowledged, not fought.

5. Glyph Set (Runtime Decision)
For this implementation, I'll default to:

A-Z + a-z (52 glyphs)
Punctuation excluded for Phase 0
Multi-component glyphs (i, j, %) handled naturally via n_components
